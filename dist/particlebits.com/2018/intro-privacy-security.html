    <aside>
    This article is the first in a series on Privacy and Security.
</aside>

<blockquote>
    <b>Privacy</b> is the balance between our control over the information
    we share and our awareness of what information is shared and with whom.
</blockquote>

<p>
    We maintain various realms of privacy as we live our lives &mdash; we have
    a personal life, a public life, a social life, etc. Information can move
    between these realms, or <b>Spheres</b> (as we'll visualize it later). The
    balance between the information we share through these realms and our
    awareness of the information that leaks between realms can be thought of
    as the <b>Privacy Spectrum</b>: "good" or "strong" privacy on one end, and
    "bad" or "weak" privacy on the other.
</p>
<p>
    If you have tight control over which information is shared to the various
    channels in your life, and if you have a strong comfort that the information
    is staying within its channel(s) (i.e. not leaking), then you are
    maintaining the privacy of your information well. If, say, some info that
    you thought was private to only you and your spouse is in fact public to
    your friends and family, then that is poor privacy: there is a big gap
    between what is being shared and your awareness of what is being shared.
    Privacy, in this sense, can be thought of as the art of maintaining this
    balance.
</p>
<p>
    How can we protect our information from leaking? How can we ensure that our
    information stays where we want it to?
</p>

<blockquote>
    <b>Security</b> is the art of protecting access to information from
    unauthorized entities.
</blockquote>

<p>
    Using the previous example, you've now added a password and confirmed that
    the data, private to you and your wife, is no longer leaking to your friends
    and family. However, you have a family member who has figured out your
    password and is now accessing the information without you knowing. This is
    "bad" or "weak" security and in this case, it's because your password is
    weak. Your security could be "hardened" by increasing the length and
    strength of your password and by logging access attempts to your private
    data. With the latter, if you left your password weak, you could still see
    that someone (not you) was logging in every night. Even keeping an audit
    log increases security, since it can show where your weak points are.
</p>
<p>
    It's important to notice the word "art" used to describe both of these
    terms. Privacy and security are an art and not a science. You're never
    finished and they're both always evolving. There are always things to learn
    and new technologies that change previous assumptions. Please observe the
    following truths:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>There is no such thing as perfect privacy or perfect security</li>
    <li>You should always think of privacy and security as a "spectrum"</li>
    <li>There always exist tradeoffs between privacy/security and convenience</li>
</ol>

<p>
    You will understand privacy and security better if you understand these
    three truths. The final point is very important to note: "tradeoffs" are
    what we encounter in the real world. They are what differ from the
    theoretical world. People make tradeoffs every day in every area of privacy
    and security in their lives. It was too much work to use a password manager,
    so you just remembered a the same password for everything. It was too much
    work to change the locks when you moved to your new apartment, so you just
    left them on the front door. This can go on and on and it's fun to think
    about all the little security holes in our lives. Pondering about and
    gaining awareness into these security holes is how you become a better
    practitioner, and how you can increase your own personal privacy and
    security. Thinking internally about what information we feel comfortable
    sharing and with whom increases our thoughtfulness and allows us to live
    more confident lives. You will invariably know more about yourself by doing
    these exercises.
</p>
<p>
    The next topic covers the six different spheres, or realms, of our lives,
    and how we maintain our privacy throughout them. You will see that strong
    privacy and security are the direct result of maintaining a tight balance
    between our personal desires and what we experience in reality. Good
    privacy is knowing exactly how much information you want to share with the
    different people or groups in your life, and having it stay that way! Good
    security is knowing as much about your weaknesses as possible, and
    mitigating or eliminating as much of that risk as possible.
</p>
<p>
    Start thinking about these different spheres in your own life, and what
    they mean to you:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Personal</li>
    <li>Private</li>
    <li>Family</li>
    <li>Social</li>
    <li>Professional</li>
    <li>Public</li>
</ol>
