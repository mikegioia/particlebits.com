    Since publication two more people won:
    <a href="http://abc7ny.com/archive/6451733/">Autumn Erhard</a> on May 30, 2013, and
    <a href="http://myfox8.com/2014/09/17/math-teacher-becomes-only-third-million-dollar-wheel-of-fortune-winner/">Sarah Manchester</a> won the third million
    on September 17, 2014. That's three winners in six years!

</figure>

<p>
    Michelle Loewenstein became the first-ever <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> millionaire on
    October 14, 2008&mdash;a mere four days after her honeymoon and six weeks after
    the Million Dollar Wedge was first introduced. It was perfect timing: Wheel's new
    million-dollar fanfare was very much at its peak, Ms. Loewenstein&mdash;a
    young florist née teacher and newlywed from New Jersey&mdash;had just come home
    from Hawaii, and on the very first spin of the game<sup>1</sup> and with a fresh
    field of letters Ms. Loewenstein landed on the sparkly wedge.
</p>
<p>
    While the Million Dollar Wedge (MDW) has certainly added renewed spectacle and a
    much higher ceiling to the game, no one has won the million since Ms. Loewenstein
    and few others have even had the opportunity. Just how winnable <i>is</i>
    this million, and just how peculiar is Ms. Loewenstein's win? The odds are so
    low and her circumstances so peculiar that Michelle Loewenstein's million dollar
    game is in all likelihood a Sony Television Pictures<sup>2</sup> creation.
</p>

<h3>A Closer Look</h3>

<figure class="r-2">
    <iframe src="https://www.youtube.com/embed/Q_rLkEXU4o4" frameborder="0" allowfullscreen></iframe>
    <figcaption>Fig 2: First million dollar win<sup>3</sup></figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Such a bold claim requires some explanation! Before getting into the data,
    however, let's first take a look at the Path to Victory, or PtV, in winning a
    million dollars:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Spin and land on the Million Dollar Wedge</li>
    <li>Guess a correct consonant</li>
    <li>Win that round</li>
    <li>Go the rest of the game without hitting a Bankrupt</li>
    <li>Finish the game with the most winnings (i.e. win the game)</li>
    <li>Spin the correct Bonus Round card</li>
    <li>Solve the Bonus Round puzzle</li>
</ol>

<p>
    Unfortunately, the networks don't release any data whatsoever about
    _Wheel of Fortune_ (or any game show for that matter). Path to Victory steps
    1, 3, 5, and 6 can all be mathematically assumed (more on that in a moment!)
    but steps 2, 4, and 7 present somewhat of a problem in requiring real-world
    data. With that in mind, I decided to watch 41    games<sup>4</sup> and record the following set of data points as a
    representative<sup>5</sup>:
</p>

<ul>
    <li>Player and round</li>
    <li>Letter guessed</li>
    <li>If they guessed correctly</li>
    <li>Who won the round and each round's prize (in USD)</li>
    <li>If they spun the MDW</li>
    <li>If they spun a Bankrupt</li>
    <li>If the spin should be ignored (i.e. Pat's final spin)</li>
</ul>

<p>
    This data serves to calculate the odds of guessing a letter correctly and how
    often players are spinning a Bankrupt in a given game. The remaining data that
    needs to be gathered are the odds of solving the Bonus Puzzle. For that, I used
    six years of historic data gathered from the The <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> Bonus
    Puzzle Compendium<sup>6</sup>, which can be seen in sheet "Bonus Rounds" of the
    spreadsheet.
</p>

<h3>Calculating the Odds</h3>

<p>
    The probability calculations for each step in the PtV are defined as follows:
</p>

<table class="centered">
    <tr>
        <th>Step</th>
        <th>Formula</th>
        <th>Probability</th>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Odds of player spinning million (A)</td>
        <td>1 &divide; 72 &times; [valid spins per game]</td>
        <td class="centered-text">8.74%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Odds of guessing letter correctly (B)</td>
        <td><em>from collected data</em></td>
        <td class="centered-text">86.55%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Odds of winning round (C)</td>
        <td>1 &divide; 3</td>
        <td class="centered-text">33.33%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Odds of post-million Bankrupt (D)</td>
        <td><em>from collected data</em></td>
        <td class="centered-text">5.91%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Odds of winning game (E)</td>
        <td>1 &divide; 3</td>
        <td class="centered-text">33.33%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Odds of spinning $1M bonus card (F)</td>
        <td>1 &divide; 24</td>
        <td class="centered-text">4.17%</td>
    </tr>
    <tr>
        <td>Odds of solving bonus puzzle (G)</td>
        <td><em>historic data used</em></td>
        <td class="centered-text">37.48</td>
    </tr>
</table>

<p>
    Before we calculate the final probability, I'd like to cover a few assumptions
    and calculations I made:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>
        The odds of <b>winning the puzzle and the game</b> are 1:3. I made no attempt
        to calculate the odds to win the round and game given any other factors. The
        main reason why I feel 1:3 is a valid assumption is because the game itself
        is subject to many random factors, and winning a big round (and thus the
        game) can happen at any moment.
    </li>
    <li>
        <b>Valid spins per game</b> is the average number of actual spins a
        singular player will make during a given game. Valid spins are any that
        occur in Rounds 1 through 3, are not vowel guesses, and are not part of
        Pat's final spin. As of this article's publishing, each player only actually
        takes and average of 6 of these "million possible"
        spins per game.
    </li>
    <li>
        The odds of a <b>post-million Bankrupt</b> are an attempt to calculate the
        likelihood of spinning a Bankrupt wedge *after* spinning the MDW (and thus
        losing the MDW). To calculate this we take the average number of Bankrupts
        from Rounds 1 through 3 and divide that number in half, assuming a 50/50
        likelihood that you spin it after or before you actually hit the MDW. Then,
        we add on the odds of spinning a Bankrupt after Round 3.
    </li>
    <li>
        The odds of <b>solving the bonus puzzle</b> come from six years worth of
        historic data and thus can be assumed to be "complete".
    </li>
</ol>

<h4>The Grand Probability</h4>

<p>
    With our table above, the final probability can be calculated using the formula:
</p>

<blockquote>
    A &times; B &times; C &times; (1 - D) &times; E &times; F &times; G
</blockquote>

<p>
    resulting in a final probability of:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <b>0.012349%</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
    That's about 1 in 8,098 players,
    2,699 games, or
    <b>every 13.8 years</b><sup>7</sup>!
</p>

<h4>The Grand Probability&hellip; With the Producers' Help</h4>

<p>
    Throughout the course of this project I've made a few notable discoveries, all
    of which have led me to believe that the producers manufactured this million
    dollar win.
</p>
<p>
    One obvious oddity regarding Ms. Loewenstein's victory is that it happened a
    mere <b>27 games</b> after Wheel even debuted the MDW!
</p>
<p>
    This is absolutely astonishing given the proposed
    2,700-game average timespan for a million dollar
    game. While this may be attributed to common luck, it becomes much less
    likely when looking at the two variables the producers control and assuming
    foul play:
</p>

<blockquote>
    Odds of spinning $1M bonus card (F)<br>
    Odds of solving bonus puzzle (G)
</blockquote>

<p>
    For (F), Wheel could put Million Dollar Bonus Cards for all 24 cards in the Bonus
    Wheel very easily, with neither Ms. Loewenstein nor the audience the wiser.
    I'll cover (G) in the next section more thoroughly,but for now it can be assumed
    trivial for Wheel to issue a very easy Bonus Puzzle.
</p>
<p>
    Removing (F) and (G) from our formula results in a final probability of:
</p>

<blockquote>
    <b>0.790809%</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
    That's about 1 in 126 players&mdash;or <b>every
    42 games</b>!&mdash;much closer to the 27 game mark
    when Ms. Loewenstein won. The show merely controlling for (F) and (G) allows for
    much more mathematical sense.
</p>

<h4>The CDMA Assumption</h4>

<figure class="r-2">
    <img src="media/2013/wheel-of-fortune/leaky_faucet.png" />
    <figcaption>Fig 3: Michelle's Bonus Puzzle</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    How could the producers know that Ms. Loewenstein would solve the Bonus Puzzle,
    though? If she failed to solve this, it would be politically difficult for Wheel to
    orchestrate <i>another</i> contestant spinning one million dollars from the Bonus
    Wheel. She simply had to get a
    <a href="media/2013/wheel-of-fortune/leaky_faucet.png">ridiculously easy one</a> (see Figure 3).
</p>
<p>
    First, <i>Wheel of Fortune</i> provides RSTLNE for the Bonus Puzzle right out of the
    gate. Applying these letters to Ms. Loewenstein's Bonus Puzzle, "Leaky Faucet",
    only yields:
</p>

<blockquote class="fixed-width">
    L E _ _ _<br>
    _ _ _ _ E T
</blockquote>

<p>
    While this isn't <i>immediately solvable</i>, it still contains the beginning and
    ending letters of the phrase.
</p>
<p>
    However, both Wheel-Watchers and a quick look at the underlying Bonus Puzzle
    data will tell you that CDMA (by far) represents the four most commonly selected
    Bonus Round letters<sup>8</sup>. Additionally, there are only <b>11 words in the
    English language ending in the suffix "cet"</b>&mdash;only two of which would ever
    appear in a puzzle or ever be generally known by a contestant (i.e., "facet" and
    "faucet")<sup>9</sup>.
</p>

<h4>The Financial Gains</h4>

<figure class="r-2">
    <img src="media/2013/wheel-of-fortune/10000_dollar_wedge_in_board.png" />
    <figcaption>Fig 4: $10,000 wedge</figcaption>
</figure>

<p>
    Finally, <i>Wheel</i> introduced the MDW to replace the $10,000 Wedge. As can be
    expected, this wedge had the same requirements to win as any other normal cash
    wedge:
</p>

<ol>
    <li>Spin the $10,000 Wedge</li>
    <li>Guess the correct consonant</li>
    <li>Win the round</li>
</ol>

<p>
    The probability here is <b>2.521578%</b>. That's about 1 in
    40 players, or once every
    13 games.
</p>
<p>
    Now, if <i>Wheel</i> pays out $10,000 from this wedge once every
    13 games that would mean the wedge has a cost per game
    (CPG) of $10,000 &divide; 13, or
    $769.23. The MDW, however, has a CPG of $1,000,000 &divide;
    2,699, or $370.51.
</p>
<p>
    The difference between these costs ($769.23 -
    $769.23) reveals the savings <i>Wheel</i> realizes each game
    upon switching to the MDW: an average of $398.72 every
    game. The peculiarity here grows when we extend these cost savings throughout
    the 2,699 game (or 13.8 years)
    timespan:
</p>

<blockquote>
    $398.72 &times; 2,699 =
    <b>$1,076,145.28</b>
</blockquote>

<p>
    By switching over from the $10,000 Wedge to the Million Dollar Wedge, Sony has
    effectively saved themselves more than $1,000,000 over
    the probabilistic estimate for each Million Dollar Winner!
</p>

<h3>Final Thoughts</h3>

<p>
    Given the extremely low odds of winning $1 million, the speed with which Ms.
    Loewenstein won, the relative ease with which Sony may control the Bonus Wheel
    and Bonus Puzzle, and the hype and positive press Sony stood to gain from getting
    an early winner, it becomes much more likely that Sony did in fact fix the
    million dollar win from 2008.
</p>
<p>
    This is pure speculation, however, and I have no actual evidence that Sony did
    anything that I'm claiming. I'm a huge fan of the show and I've loved watching
    and recording this game data &mdash; it was a lot of fun and I've grown to love
    Wheel and Wheel culture. I will more than likely continue recording more and more
    game data and updating the spreadsheet for a while.
</p>
<p>
    Finally, I think Sony and other game show networks should release historical data
    (as much as possible) to allow hobbyists and fans to do interesting and fun
    things. There's so many insights that we can get from these games and having
    structured data would be fantastic!
</p>

    corrections or fixes if you've noticed anything from my analysis and spreadsheet
    calculations.

                    Great article? Have you considered the odds accounting for the MDW being physically smaller? I would love to see more data I'm wheel fan and love to see more stats on players decisions. Also data on how much money players win relative to the other players since everyone "wins". Last thought: could her winning only 27 games actually prove the game is truly random?                </div>

                    Justin: "Have you considered the odds accounting for the MDW being physically smaller?"

He did... there are 24 normal-size slots on the wheel, and the MDW is 1/3rd the size of a normal slot, so 24*3 = 72.

"Odds of player spinning million (A)    1 ÷ 72 × [valid spins per game]"                </div>

                    What I'm wondering about is why all the mentions of 'ABC' as if they're responsible for production decisions? Wheel is a syndicated show airing on many channels including some ABC channels, but everything I've seen indicates the companies responsible for producing it are Sony and CBS.                </div>

                    @Ann There's no reason why, I just assumed it was ABC since it airs on ABC in New York! I didn't realize the show was syndicated so much.

Sony does in fact own the rights to the show, and CBS has the US distribution rights. I would say in this case it was Sony then that is the "owner". I should update this to reflect that and add a footnote.                </div>

                    The small wheel contains a $100,000 card (amongst the other smaller prize cards) which is replaced with a $1M card if the player has the MDW.                </div>

                    One has a better 'chance' and that is what it is of obtaining the correct '6' numbers in the Florida lottery.   275,000,000: 1.  Good Luck to all.  Fun for ALL but in the end it's a [suckers] game thinking that 'you' will be the sole winner.                </div>
